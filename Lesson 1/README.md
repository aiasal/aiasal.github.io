👋 Hi! ✨

This repository is created for learing purposes, where I'm experimenting with code to see if I would like to pursue this further and just understand the basics more. 🤓

So from here you can find my "Development 101" materials of how I am starting with the basics — learning how Git works, writing simple programs in Javascript, C and C++. The goal is to see how deep the rabbit hole goes 🌪️ 🌺
